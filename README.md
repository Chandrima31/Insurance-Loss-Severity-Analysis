I tried to go very in-depth with understanding Linear Regression and Random Forest for this work. 
I kept the motto to understand different parameters/ hyperparameters used by the models. Focus is not on earning a high score here. 
Keeping this objective in mind, I avoided using XGBoost or LightGBM.

<b> Key takeaways: </b>

Adversarial Validation - A diagnostic way to check the similarity between Training and Test data sets
Feature Transformation - Log transformation to reduce variable skewness and test normality with QQ-plot
Regularizations (L1 and L2 Penalties) - Effect of regularization parameter on Lasso and Ridge coefficients
Residuals Plot and Prediction Error Plot - Regression model's performance analysis visually
Visualize Random Forest - Visual change in model plot w.r.t. change in different hyperparameters viz. n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_leaf.
