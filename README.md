<b> 
Data: Allstate Claims Historical Records 
</b>

I tried to go very in-depth with understanding Linear Regression and Random Forest for this work. 
I kept the motto to understand different parameters/ hyperparameters used by the models. Focus is not on earning a high score here. 
Keeping this objective in mind, I avoided using XGBoost or LightGBM.

<b> Key takeaways: </b>
<ul>
<li>Adversarial Validation - A diagnostic way to check the similarity between Training and Test data sets</li>
<li>Feature Transformation - Log transformation to reduce variable skewness and test normality with QQ-plot</li>
<li>Regularizations (L1 and L2 Penalties) - Effect of regularization parameter on Lasso and Ridge coefficients</li>
<li>Residuals Plot and Prediction Error Plot - Regression model's performance analysis visually</li>
<li>Visualize Random Forest - Visual change in model plot w.r.t. change in different hyperparameters viz. n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_leaf.</li>
</ul>
